# Common-Syntax-Error-and-Solution
When Copy and Paste is used Too Much

Processing-JAVA syntax error
- Sometimes Processing-JAVA's debugger will describe a syntax error that is not true
- Solution:
  - Open new processing-java program
  - copy code to Notepad.txt (deletes all hidden formatting tags)
  - copy from Notepad.txt to new Processing.pde file (including creating any TABs
- Test new Processing.pde file to ensure formatting tags are *not* copied over
